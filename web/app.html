				<h3>Languages</h3>
				<section>
					<h4>Javascript &amp; NodeJS</h4>
					<p>I've used Javascript in almost any scope you can imagine. I'm very fluent with <a class="external" href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and DOM manipulation, although more recently I've been building entire Javascript driven single-page web applications using technologies such as <a class="external" href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and <a class="external" href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>. Javascript has been used in essentially every web application I've worked and is one of my favourite languages to code in.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
					<p>Being a web application developer, it's hard to not obtain an extensive knowledge of HTML and my case is no exception. I've also had the pleasure of developing modern web applications that utilize new technolgoies; such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> and <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS3</a>, while remaining functional in older browsers (as far back as IE6). Most recently I've been utilizing CSS pre-compilers such as <a class="external" href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> and it's hard to imagine going back to anything else.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>PHP</h4>
					<p>One of my strongest languages. I've been coding in PHP since the first day I could code. Object-Oriented and frameworks such as <a class="external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend</a>, <a class="external" href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org">Silex</a> and <a class="external" href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> are second-nature to me. From single-page sites to large-scale web applications, I've done them all.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Python</h4>
					<p>By far my favourite language to code in, largely attributed to it's beautiful syntax. When building a web application in <a class="external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, I've found <a class="external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> the most satisfying.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Git</h4>
					<p>Always my first choice for version control, from personal to large-scale business projects. My knowledge of <a class="external" href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> is extensive and I'm a strong advocate of the pull request, peer review style of development.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Swift &amp; Objective-C</h4>
					<p>Although I don't know these technologies well yet, I never stop learning and my goal to teach myself <a class="external" href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> &amp; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective-C</a> so I can code my first native iOS application.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>MySql, Postgres, MongoDB and Redis</h4>
					<p>Every project is different, but usually I choose one or two of these databases depending on the scale or requirements of the application. Generally I'm a big advocate of keeping the database strictly as a datastore and using your application for all the complicated business logic. I've known many people who are persistent on putting far too much application logic straight into the database layer through features like stored procedures, only to see it explode and quickly become unmaintable. In terms of relational vs NoSql, it really is a decision you make on a case-by-case basis.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Unit and Functional Testing</h4>
					<p>It's one of those things you don't realize how important it is until you actually start doing it. And once you start, you won't go back. Every application I develop now is always done with testing in mind. Test first, code second. Being a believer of continuous deployment makes it easy to see the value in unit tests. You won't find me coding without them.</p>

				<h3>Roles</h3>
				<section>
					<h4>Lead Programmer</h4>
					<p>I've been overseeing the development of CoursePark for nearly 4 years as the Lead Programmer, managing our 7 senior developers and providing guidance whenever possible. On a daily basis I'm involved in problem solving and architecting solutions that satisfy our tight deadlines while keeping future development efforts in mind. To help achieve our demanding goals, I have implemented short iteration cycles and a continuous deployment workflow that focuses on automated unit tests and peer code review.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Release Engineer</h4>
					<p>As the Release Engineer on CoursePark, I'm in charge of ensuring we always have a stable, but latest version to release. I manage the automated compilation, assembly and delivery of source code to our prodution servers. Essentially no code goes to production without first being approved by me.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Infrastructure Engineer</h4>
					<p>Building applications used by thousands of users means you also need to scale it. So I have plenty of experience with planning and implementing scalable infrastructures using technologies such as <a class="external" href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet</a> and more recently <a class="external" href="http://docker.io">Docker</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Project Management</h4>
					<p>Being the Lead Programmer on the cornerstone product of a million dollar company has often pushed me into the Project Management role. I often manage scope, along with determining the risk and the resources required as well as problem solving.</p>

				<h3><a class="external" href="https://rentchek.com">RentChek</a></h3>
				<h4>Built in 2014</h4>
				<p>This is my latest project. I came up with the idea out of a personal desire to make it easier to manage my rental properties. It's built with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>, <a class="external" href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, <a class="external" href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, <a class="external" href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>, <a class="external" href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> and <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a>. All these technolgoies were still fairly new to me, but I was quick to learn from my previous experiences with Javascript.</p>
				<p>Some other important tools I utilized for this project included <a class="external" href="http://bower.io">Bower</a>, <a class="external" href="https://npmjs.org">npm</a> and <a class="external" href="http://expressjs.com">express</a>.</p>

				<h3><a class="external" href="http://synapsie.com">Synapsie</a></h3>
				<h4>Built in 2011</h4>
				<p>I built Synapsie as an opportunity to learn Python web development and it accomplished this nicely. It was a great learning experiment that introduced me to the increasingly popular Django Framework as well as Facebook Connect.</p>
				<p>For the development of Synapsie, I used a <a class="external" href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant Virtual Machine</a> along with Puppet for server configuration. I implemented a simple RESTful API and the majority of the UX is accomplished using jQuery and calls to the API. Although I'm not much of a designer, I did design Synapsie myself using Adobe Illustrator and I think it turned out well.</p>

				<h3><a class="external" href="http://www.coursepark.com">CoursePark</a></h3>
				<h4>From 2008 &mdash; Present</h4>
				<p>I have worked on CoursePark ever since I was hired at <a class="external" href="http://www.bluedrop.com">Bluedrop</a>. CoursePark was little more than a thought scribbled on paper when we started development and has since become a cornerstone product from Bluedrop with 10s of thousands of active users.</p>
				<p>About a year into development I was promoted to Lead Programmer of CoursePark and my team and I have never stopped improving the application. We continue to implement the latest technologies such as the newly established eLearning API called <a class="external" href="http://tincanapi.com">TinCan</a> and we are in the process of expanding to a mobile offering. As Lead on the project, I pushed us towards a Continuous Deployment model utilizing Unit &amp; Functional Tests along with Pull Request style peer review. We also migrated from using SVN to GIT for version control which showed substantial performance improvements and allowed us to obtain the rapid development and release workflow we needed.</p>
				<p>We built CoursePark on PHP, Postgres and the Zend Framework using the MVC architecture pattern. Our servers have been architected to provide a reliable uptime, performance and avoid any single point of failure. Vagrant VMs are used for local development along with Puppet scripts for managing development and production configurations.</p>
