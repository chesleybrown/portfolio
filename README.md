# Running Locally

Server runs on port `8000` by default, but will use the port set
on the environment variable `PORT` if set.

1. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env`
1. Set all the ENV vars in `.env`
1. Run `npm run grunt server` to start the server.

## Running Tests
To execute all the tests, just run:

```
npm test
```
